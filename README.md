SeismoBug P Application (SBP)
The SeismoBug P Application (SBP) is a Python-based tool designed to interface with SeismoBug P devices, facilitating data acquisition, processing, and visualization for seismic analysis.

Features
Device Communication: Establishes and manages connections with SeismoBug P devices for real-time data streaming.
Data Processing: Includes scripts for processing and analyzing seismic data, such as postprocess_T7.py and oma.py.
Visualization: Provides tools for plotting and visualizing seismic data, including Jupyter notebooks like Plot_single.ipynb.
User Interface: Offers a graphical user interface for ease of use, implemented in mainUI.py.
